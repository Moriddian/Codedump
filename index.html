<h1>What About Coding Do I Like?</h1>
<p>I find coding to be very unique, there's so many different languages and they are all very enjoyable to learn. Coding can be used for anything from coding games, which is really fun to see what you can make, building AI, as well as cybersecurity, all of these are different areas of code that I'm interested in. </p>
